This is an entirely simplified version of https://github.com/jens-maus/carddav2fb. The Vcard parser has been replaced by an extended version of https://github.com/jeroendesloovere/vcard.

## Features

  * download from any number of CardDAV servers
  * selection (include/exclude) by categories or groups (e.g. iCloud)
  * upload of contact pictures to display them on the FRITZ!Fon (handling see below)
  * transfer of quick dial and vanity numbers (see wiki for handling details)
  * if more than nine phone numbers are included, the contact will be divided into a corresponding number of phonebook entries (any existing email addresses are assigned to the first set [there is no quantity limit!])
  * phone numbers are sorted by type. The order of the conversion values ('phoneTypes') determines the order in the phone book entry
  * the contact's UID of the CardDAV server is added to the phonebook entry (not visible in the FRITZ! Box GUI)
  * automatically preserves QuickDial and Vanity attributes of phone numbers
    set in FRITZ!Box Web GUI. Works without config. (Hint: If you used the
    old way of configuring your CardDav server with X-FB-QUICKDIAL /X-FB-VANITY, then your old config is respected and this new automatic feature is skipped).
  * generates an image with keypad and designated quickdial numbers, which can be uploaded to designated handhelds (see details below)
